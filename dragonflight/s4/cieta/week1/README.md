## Sims

### Steps

Note: Change steps to account for the 90 crest limit.

1. Compare acquired gear to current
   1. Top gear with all acquired gear on it
2. Compare acquired to shard crafted
   1. Dropimizer for crafted gear (all stats) using above at starter
3. Compare acquired + shard crafted to used whelping crests until all 120 are used
   1. Top Gear with each item upgraded + crafted item as a vault selection
   2. Add item and run until out of crests.

Zen Malygite in other two sockets.

#### Change Embellishment?

After all gear, gems are now moving to Mastery. Check if Blue Silken Lining is better after all gear upgrades are done.

https://www.raidbots.com/simbot/report/3LDTbJYiqPv4tMVipCiHV2

No, stil with Rolling Shadowflame.

**Final Decision**

~~Use https://www.raidbots.com/simbot/report/9mYUhkwWrSHWmAoonqULmm as final result.

Craft Staff, Neck, and Pants (ignore Ring)~~

Changed final result to https://www.raidbots.com/simbot/report/6xGa3oVLg5EiBckFpAbmDo.

## Mythic+ Runs to Target

https://www.raidbots.com/simbot/report/pWEZs81ZDEaSdP1vxYxryk

| Priority | Dungeons                                                                         |
| -------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1        | The Nokhud Offensive, The Azure Vault                                            |
| 2        | Ruby Life Pools, Neltharus                                                       |
| 3        | Brackenhide Hollow, Uldaman: Legacy of Tyr, Halls of Infusion, Algeth'ar Academy |

## Are Heroics worth doing?

https://www.raidbots.com/simbot/report/6sFz2pnQmnx8gcbrCeXarP

Only four dungeons drops upgrades and the best upgrade is only 2.8% (a trinket). Doesn't seem worth the time.
