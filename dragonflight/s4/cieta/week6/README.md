Even though [Wowhead](https://www.wowhead.com/guide/classes/warlock/demonology/bis-gear#bullions) says to get [Voice of the Silent Star](https://www.wowhead.com/item=204465/voice-of-the-silent-star?bonus=7981:10358:5871), [Seal of Diurna's Chosen](https://www.wowhead.com/item=195480/seal-of-diurnas-chosen?bonus=7981:10358:5871) sims better.

No other gear stat changes needed. Recommending using the Mastery enchant with the ring.
