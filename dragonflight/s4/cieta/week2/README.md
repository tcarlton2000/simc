## Sims

### Steps

1. Compare acquired gear to current
   1. Top gear with all acquired gear on it (include Veteran or high previously acquired gear)
2. Run Dropimizer for bullion with previous step best equipped.
   1. Question this if item is not on Wowhead bullion use list
   1. Might want to go ahead and use all Drake + Wyrm Crests possible on this.
3. Compare previous step to remaining whelpling crests crafted gear + upgrading current Veteran/Adventurer gear.
    1. Use Top Gear with each possible item upgrade as "Vault Items"
    2. Run until out of crests
